I am not a computer science major. That has very little to do with whether or
not I can code.


Hopefully, my projects on this GitHub page show that. In addition, this
repository contains template implementations of various algorithms, data
structures, and design patterns to show that very little has been lost in not having a computer science degree.


I hope no one should be impressed by these, they should just check a box.


Many of them inherit from and are implemented in terms of eachother for code
reuse. For example, a set is a certain implementation of a binary search tree,
so my set implementation overrides some choice binary search tree methods.
