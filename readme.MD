I am not a computer science major. That has very little to do with whether or
not I can code.

Hopefully, my projects on this GitHub page show that. In addition, this
repository contains implementations of various algorithms and data structures to
show that very little has been lost in not having a computer science degree.

No one should be impressed by these, they just check a box.
